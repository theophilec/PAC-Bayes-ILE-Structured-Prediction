# PAC-Bayesian ILE Structured Prediction

This repository accompanies the pre-print **A PAC-Bayesian Perspective on Structured Prediction with Implicit Loss Embeddings** by [Théophile Cantelobre](https://theophilec.github.io) (Mines ParisTech, Inria), [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io) (Inria, UCL), [María Pérez-Ortiz](http://mariaperezortiz.com) (UCL) and [John Shawe-Taylor](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/) (UCL).

The pre-print is available here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03780).

## Requirements

On top of standard machine learning requirements, this repository requires `jax` (for auto-diff) and `scikit-ml` (for data).

## Getting started

We use the `scikit-learn` API as much as possible... you should be able to jump right in. To get started, you can take a look at `demo_relaxed.py` and `demo_mc.py`.

Jupyter notebooks are for reproducing figures (`Section-7.ipynb` depends on `sensitivity-*.py`, which takes a while to run).

## Contact

If you have any issues with the code, feel free to open an issue. To chat about the paper, ping me at `theophilec#gmail.com`.
